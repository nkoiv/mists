# mists
A realtime Roguelike adventure for cs.hel.fi javalab.

So far you can move around in a procedurally generated dungeon, dodging monsters and burrowing through walls. Move around with arrow keys and use space to attack (walls or creatures). Shift-button toggles monsters to life, esc brings up the main menu.
