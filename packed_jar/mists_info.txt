Mists is an Action RPG built with Java8, and as such it requires JRE1.8+. It features pretty much exactly what you'd expect from an arpg: Exploration, combat, procedural generation, loot, light dialogue, puzzles, and so on. The goal of this demo is to find the fabled stuffed animal, the Himmutoy. It's pretty so very snuggly.

You'll start the game on a beach with no items to your name. Armed with only your trusty fireball spell you'll need to find a weapon somewhere before setting off to the Dungeon. That is, unless you want to go unarmed. Going unarmed is totally fine too, even if somewhat more challenging.

Game controls can be displayed inside the game by pressing Esc, but the core controls are as follows:
- WASD/Arrows (or mouse) to move around 
- Space to attack with a weapon if you have one
- Numberkeys for the buttons on the actionbar (firebolts are shot towards mouse position)
- E or mouseclick to toggle an object that's selected
- Q to swap between selected objects
- Mouse click can be used to focus on a target, both for E-clicks and Fireballs.
